# UFOs

## Project Overview
We are helping Dana to build a webpage that displays information about UFO sightings using JavaScript along with an HTML index file and CSS style file.  The webpage contains a list of UFO sightings with information around each sighting (date, city, state, country and shape).  This first iteration of the webpage had a filter to allow the user to select only sightings on a certain date - if filter was not used, all the data would be displayed.

We have been tasked with building on the webpage we designed together which contained one filter to one that allows users to filter on up to all 5 pieces of information.

# Deliverable: Filter UFO sightings on multiple creteria
We needed to adjust both the HTML idex file to add the filters onto the website.

Then we needed to adjust one of the buildTable function to bring in 
![Table_for_Map_with_Markers](https://github.com/tessiertodd/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation_map.png))

Next we need to build a new function in our JavaScript file that would take the filters selected, loop through all the data and return the filtered dataset based on those filters to back to the webpage.

![Table_with_markers_for_itinerary](https://github.com/tessiertodd/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png)

# Summary
Once these filters have been added to the website, this allows the users to much more easily analyze the data and get some insight around the topic of UFO sightings.

The drawback of this webpage is that the dataset we are using is static and a little dated as its from 2010. Users cannot get information that is recent.
